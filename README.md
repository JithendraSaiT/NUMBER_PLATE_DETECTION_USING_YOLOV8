# DATA
Video used can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11YLP6CubZBnSDUg3Ff0Wx5hvp6xoOHs_/view?usp=drive_link)
# Models
Yolov8 pretrained model was used to detect vehicles and to detect license plates the model was trained with Yolov8 using [this dataset.](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4)
# SORT(Dependencies)
A simple online and realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences is needed and it is available in [this repository.](https://github.com/abewley/sort)
