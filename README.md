# Models
Yolov8 pretrained model was used to detect vehicles and to detect license plates the model was trained with Yolov8 using [this dataset.](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4)
# SORT(Dependencies)
A simple online and realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences is needed and it is available in [this repository.](https://github.com/abewley/sort)
